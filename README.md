# Penetration Testing (PenTest)

PenTest is a security testing performed to evaluate a system's ability to protect its application, networks, endpoints and mainly the users from attacks. Penetration Testing is not same as Vulnerability Assessment. 

We are trying to collate and provide a single repository for PenTest comrpising of the detailed steps involved in performing the PenTest, tools and various other resources that is required to learn, practice and perform PenTest independently.

## Benefits of PenTest
 - Protecting Organisation Reputation
 - Reveal Security Vulnerabilities
 - Ensuring Compliance with regulations and Certifications
 - Effective Risk Management
 - Evaluating Cyber-defense capabilities
 - Identify the ROI for existing security measures
 - Need for additional measures in-place
 - Ensure Business Continuity
 - Maintain Trust

## Types of Assessments
- Goal or Objective-based Assessment
- Compliance-based Assessment
- Red Team Assessments

## Types of Strategies
- Black Box Testing
- Gray Box Testing
- White Box Testing
