# Steps involved in PenTesting

## Planning and Scoping Penetration Testing

There are various considerations when planning and scoping a PenTest. 
  - Planning
    - Target Audience [Higher Management, IT Team, Web Team, etc]
    - Resources 
    - Budget
    - Technical Constraints
    - Legal Restrictions
    - Rules of Engagement
      - Timeline
      - Location of Testing
      - Test Boundaries
    - Contract 
      - Master Service Agreement (MSA)
      - Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
      - Statement of Work (SOW)
    - Authorizations
    - Disclaimers

  - Scoping
    - Goals 
    - Deliverables
    - Assessment Method
    - Strategy 
    - Threat Model
    - Targets 
    - Impact Analysis
    - Risk Management
    - Scheduling tasks
    - Checklists
    
  - Preparation 
    - Team Preparation
    - Activity Assignment
    - Communication Path
    - Contigency Plans
    - Going Live 
    - Data Collection
    - Documentation

## Perform Passive Reconnaissance

  - Information Gathering using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
    - Methods 
      - Whois Search
      - Organization Website
      - Social Media Profiles (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc)
      - Job Portals
      - DNS Quering 
      - SSL/TLS Certificates
      - IP Address and Subdomains
      - Google Hacking
    - Tools
      - Recon-ng
      - Shodan
      - theHarvester
      - Maltego
      - FOCA     
    - Social Engineering Methods
      - Phishing (Vishing, SMSishing, Spear Phishing, Whaling)
      - Spam and Spim
      - URL Hijacking
      - Hoax
      - Baiting
      - Shoulder Surfing 
      - Tailgating and Piggybacking
    - Physical Non-Technical Methods
      - Dumpster Diving
      - Badge Cloning
      - Fence Jumping 
      - Lock Picking and Bypassing
      - Motion Detecton Bypassing 
      
## Perform Active Reconnaissance

  - Network Scanning using Nmap and Metasploit 
    - Packet Crafting
    - Port Scanning 
    - Host Discovery 
    - Service Discovery
  - Device Enumeration 
    - Banner Grabbing
    - Network Share Enumeration
    - Service and Application Enumeration
    - Windows and Linux Enumeration
    - Website Enumeration   
  - Vulnerability Scanning
    - Host Vulnerability
    - Service Vulnerability (Network and Server)
    - Network Device Vulnerability
    - Firewall Vulnerability
    - Application Vulnerability
    - Container Vulnerability
    - Wireless Vulnerability (WiFi)
    
## Analyze Vulnerabilities

## Penetration to Networks

## Vulnerabilities Exploitation

## Post-Exploitation

## Analyze and Report PenTest Results
