# PenTesting - Terminologies

## Master Service Agreement (MSA)
An agreement that establishes precedence and guidelines for any business documents that are executed between parties. 
Generally, it can be used to cover recurring costs, warranties, intellectual property and foreseen additional changes during a project without the need for an additional contract.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
A legal or business document that stipulates that the agreed parties will not share confidential information, knowledge, or materials with unauthorized third parties.
It is also referred to as Confidentiality Agreement (CA), Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA), Proprietary Information Agreement (PIA) or Secrecy Agreement (SA).

## Statement Of Work (SOW)
A business document that defines the highest level of expectations for a contractual arrangement. 
It defines project-specific list of deliverables, responsibilities, payment milestones and schedules, and other terms. 
Because this document details what the client is paying for, it has a direct impact on team activities. 
The pen test team can document the charges for out-of-scope requests and additional client-incurred costs.

It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.
